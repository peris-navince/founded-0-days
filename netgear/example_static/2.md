# How I did static analysis:
First,export disassembly file as C file;  
Second, global search acosNvramConfig_get;  
Then,check whether the variable obtained by acosNvramConfig_get performs the risk function operation;  
Finally,check whether the variable obtained by acosNvramConfig_get is constructed from external network input(like websgetvar) and saved into nvram(acosNvramConfig_set).
