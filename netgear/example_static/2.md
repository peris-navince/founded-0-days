# How I did static analysis:
First,export disassembly file as C file;  
Second, global search acosNvramConfig_get;  
Then,check whether the variable obtained by acosNvramConfig_get performs the risk function operation;  
Finally,check whether the variable obtained by acosNvramConfig_get is constructed from external network input(like websgetvar) and saved into nvram(acosNvramConfig_set).  

# Poc construction
The construction of poc needs to be combined with front-end and back-end code analysis, that is, the firmware's front-end code after binwalk -Me and disassembled back-end code.
Find functions similar to websgetvar in the back-end code, extract the parameters, and find the related HTML and action cgi in the front-end code.
